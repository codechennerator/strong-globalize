this file contains a long text which normally exceeds the length limitation of the strings messages.json can store.  In that case, there are two easy solutions: 1. split the message into two or more manageable strings and concatenate -- note that the split had better be done at sentence boundary so that the translation to other languages can be done.  Second approach is to store the single lengthy string in a text file like this one and reads it as `g.f('longtext.txt')`.
